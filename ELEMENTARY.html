		<p id="pag1"><b>When</b> i was in elementary, i moved to the city in 4th grade because of my father's work, since then we have been staying in the city and we rarely go back to the province. Since then, I have learned what life is like in the city, and I can compare what life is like in the province and the city. The adjustment was very difficult for me. When I was in elementary school,I experienced bullying, because I'm from the province, I didn't fight them because I was new to the city, all the bullying they did to me, I hide it, I didn't tell my parents. in our province I was very active, I participated in programs, but when I arrived in the city, I lost my self confidence. <em>Bullying has a very strong impact on a person</em></p>
